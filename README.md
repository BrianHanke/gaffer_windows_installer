# Gaffer Windows Installer

A small app to help install Gaffer on Windows. It uses the GitHub API to check for all Gaffer Windows releases, including alphas and betas. Select one from the dropdown, choose your options and install. The appropriate files will be downloaded and extracted, with optional creation of start menu/desktop shortcuts and ARNOLD_ROOT system environment variable.
